# Predictions-of-European-Basketball-Match-Results-with-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

The goal of this paper is to build and compare methods for the prediction of the final outcomes of basketball games. In our study we analyse data from four different European tournaments: the Greek Basket League, the Spanish Liga ACB and the European tournaments of Euroleague and Eurocup. The data-set consist of information collected by box scores of 5214 games for the period of  2013-2018. The available data were divided into three distinct sets: historical predictors, train set and  test set. The predictions obtained by our implemented methods and models were compared with a “vanilla” model using only the team-name information of each game. In our analysis we have included new performance indicators constructed by using historical statistics and key performance indicators measurements from three rating systems (Elo, pagerank, pi-rating) which we tune the necessary parameters for our tournaments. These new game specific features are improving our predictions efficiently and can be easily obtained in any basketball league. Our predictions were obtained by implementing three different statistics and machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest and the extreme gradient boosting trees). Moreover,  we also report predictions based on the combination of these algorithms. We evaluate our predictions using several predictive measures: Brier Score, accuracy and $F_1$-score. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms with three different scenarios (full season, mid-season and play-offs predictive evaluation). 
    For mid-season and play-offs scenarios we further explore whether incorporating additional results from previous seasons in the learning data-set enhances the  predictive performance of the implemented models and algorithms. 
    Finally, we present the  most important features by counting the percentage  of appearance in every machine learning algorithm for every of three analyses and we discuss difficulties and anomalies in the predictions.
